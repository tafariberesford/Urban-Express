## Overview

_**Urban Express** is a website that features the top 10 songs that we released in 2021 so far - where users can view and leave their own review of the songs listed on our top 10.


<br>

## MVP

_The **Urban Express** will have a homepage which renders song review data (written by myself) and users should be able to perform CRUD operations when leaving their own review.

<br>

### Goals

- Homepage should feature a list of the top 10 songs featured.
- Users should be able to leave review(s) on songs
- 3 media queries for 3 different screen sizes.
- Inline CSS styling using Framer Motion

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ components/
      |__ homepage.js
      |__ signIn.js
      |__ signUp.js
      |__ footer.js
      |__ songReview.js
      |__ userReview.js
      |__ signOut.js
      |__ deleteReview.js
|__ services/
      |__ apiconfig.js
|__ views/
      |__ Home.jsx

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.
