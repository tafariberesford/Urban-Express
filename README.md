# README

## Overview

_**Urban Express** is a website that features the top 10 songs that we released in 2021 - where users can view and leave their own review of the songs listed on our top 10. Users will also be able to look at my own reviews for the top 10 songs that were chosen by myself.


<br>

## MVP

_The **Urban Express** will have a homepage which renders song review data (written by myself) and users should be able to perform CRUD operations when leaving their own review.

<br>

### Goals

- Homepage should feature a list of the top 10 songs featured.
- Users should be able to leave review(s) on songs
- 3 media queries for 3 different screen sizes.
- Inline CSS styling using Framer Motion
